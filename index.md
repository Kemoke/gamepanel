# Game Server Web Panel

It has come a time when gaming has evolved from an after-work activity to a real work activity. Not so long ago when people were unable to even cope with the thought of huge conferences where video games would be marketed, gaming tournaments being held and billions of dollars being circulated just for gaming purposes. 

In such a market where multiplayer gaming has taken the main field in many games and even more of them made specially for multiplayer gaming, servers are of crucial value. Stable servers that can be up and running in no time, that can be maintained with a single click and would give constant feedback to its owner about its status, is sadly often just a dream. This the point where GamePanel kicks in.

GamePanel is a web based panel for managing game servers. It allows integrating many game servers from its users which will run on remote machines. Users, in this case clients or admin, will be able to do basic operations on running game servers, such as stop and play as well as selling them, while the information about servers will be given by the system. 

The market is saturated with outdated and complicated panel software. All of the good and maintained products are private ownership of hosting companies. This software would allow easier management of large number of game servers that all have different ways of installation, monitoring and would cut down on time required to set up a brand new server for the client that ordered the server.
